7. Amazon
---------------------------------------------------------------
Question 1:
-----------
There're multiple delivery centers and delivery warehouses all over the world. The world is represented by a line of numbers -10^9 to 10^9. There are n delivery centers, the ith one at location center[i]. A location x is called a suitable location for a warehouse if it is possible to bring all the products to that point by traveling a distance of no more than d. At any one time, products can be brought from one delivery center and placed at point x. Given the positions of n delivery centers, calculate the number of suitable locations in the world. That is, calculate the number of points x on the number line (-10^9 <= x <= 10^9) where the travel distance required to bring all the products to that point is less than or equal to d.
Note: The distance between point x and center[i] is |× - center[i]|, their absolute difference.
Constraints: d <= 10^15!
Example: Given n = 3, center = [-2, 1, 0], d = 8.
-------
Expected result: The only suitable locations are {-1, 0, 1}. Return 3.
----------------
Explanation: Locate the warehouse at x = 0, total distance traveled is 2 * |0 - (-2)| + 2 * |0 - 1 | + 2 * |0 - 0| = 6 ≤ d. Thisis a suitable location. Locate the warehouse at x = - 1, 
------------
total distance traveled is 2 * |-1 - (-2)| + 2 * |-1 - 1 | + 2 * |-1 - 0| = 8 ≤ d. This is a suitable location. Locate the warehouse al × = 1, total distance traveled is 2 * |1- (-2)| + 2 * |1 - 1 | + 2 * |1 - 0| = 8 ≤ d.

Question 2:
-----------
Developers at Amazon have their applications deployed on n servers. Initially, the ith server has an id server[i] and can handle server[i] requests at a time.
For maintenance purposes, some servers are replaced periodically. On a jth day, all the servers with id equal to replaceld[] are replaced with servers with id newld[j] that can serve newldj] requests. The total number of requests served on a jth day is the sum of the ids of the servers that the application is running on.

Given server, replaceld, and newld, find the total number of requests served by the servers each day.
